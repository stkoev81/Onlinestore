This is an online store application based on Java EE that I created as a learning 
project. The source code and UML 
are available here, and list of the features is here. I have tried to make it 
realistic. This application should be usable by a real business if it is properly 
deployed, customized according to the business rules, and decorated 
with more attractive front-end design.
