                    This is an online store for selling books and CD's. I developed
                    it to practice with some of the common Java Enterprise technologies
                    and tools. The source code, UML, business rules, and documentation 
                    are available <a href="http://www.skoev.com/">here</a>.                     
                </p>

                <p> The application has not only customer user roles (for placing orders)
                    but also employee user roles (for managing products and processing orders). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope that you check it out and let me know what you think. You can:

                             as one of the pre-defined <b>DEMO accounts</b>, 
                            some of which have employee user roles (password is simply p)

                <p> This applicaiton is currently being hosted on a Glassfish 3.1 server and MySQL
